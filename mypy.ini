# Target specific modules for type checking - Gradual Adoption Strategy
# 
# Phase 1 (Current): Core modules and routers with strict checking
# These modules are critical for security and application logic, making them
# the highest priority for type safety. They have relatively stable APIs.
#
# Phase 2 (Next): Models with checked untyped defs
# Database models are foundational but may require more type annotations.
#
# Criteria for adding modules to strict checking:
# 1. Code stability (not frequently refactored)
# 2. Security-critical functionality
# 3. Clear type boundaries
# 4. Existing type hint coverage > 70%
