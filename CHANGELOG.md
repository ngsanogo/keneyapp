### Added - Continuous Improvement Cycle Iteration 4

#### CI/CD
- Updated Codecov uploads to use the v5 `files` input and tolerate transient failures, restoring backend/frontend job stability.
- Upgraded GitHub CodeQL actions to v3 and guarded the analysis job against forked pull requests where security events cannot be published.
- Adopted the latest `actions/setup-python@v5` across workflows for consistent toolchain provisioning.
- Fixed backend CodeQL job triggering on forked pull requests by gating the workflow on same-repo events only.
- Added a docker-compose smoke test job that builds the stack, waits for health, and surfaces backend logs on failure.

#### Infrastructure
- Aligned backend Docker image with the supported Python 3.11 base to match local/runtime environments and ensure prebuilt database drivers are available during builds.
- Hardened Alembic migrations to no-op when base tables are provisioned later by SQLAlchemy metadata, allowing greenfield environments to bootstrap without schema conflicts.
- Removed deprecated `version` declaration from `docker-compose.yml` to silence warnings on Compose v2.

#### Frontend
- Removed legacy default `React` import from the error boundary to restore TypeScript build compatibility with the new JSX transform.

#### Security & Dependencies
- Pinned `bcrypt` to 4.1.2 to remain compatible with Passlib and avoid runtime attribute errors during container start-up.

#### Documentation
- Documented tenant-aware seeding expectations and CI automation in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.

### Added - Continuous Improvement Cycle Iteration 3

  - Container security scanning (Trivy)
  - SARIF report upload to GitHub Security

- Hardened `require_roles` to normalize role input (lists or variadic) while preserving implicit `super_admin` access, preventing configuration typos from silently relaxing authorization.

#### Testing
- Added focused unit coverage for the RBAC dependency to assert list handling, denial behavior, and `super_admin` bypass rules.

#### Tooling & DX
- Reduced mypy noise around RBAC usage by improving dependency typing, making type-checking output more actionable for developers.

### Added - Continuous Improvement Cycle Iteration 2

#### Security & Compliance
- Automatic bootstrap of a default tenant and administrator (behind `ENABLE_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN`) to keep contract tests and smoke tests deterministic while preserving the ability to disable it in hardened environments.
- RBAC guard now grants `super_admin` accounts implicit access to protected routes, aligning authorization with organizational policies.

#### API
- Login endpoint now emits proper validation errors (`422`) when username or password is missing, improving client contract guarantees.
